**SDIS** - Labs and Project Code
Repo for the code for the Lab classes and Projects for the **Distributed Systems (SDIS)** class of the **Msc/Bsc in Informatics and Computer Engineering (MIEIC)** at the **Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP)**.

!! The labs may not be completed or buggy !!

Project 1 is a serverless **distributed backup service** for a local area network (LAN). The idea is to use the free disk space of the computers in a LAN for backing up files in other computers in the same LAN. The service is provided by servers in an environment that is assumed cooperative (rather than hostile). Nevertheless, each server retains control over its own disks and, if needed, may reclaim the space it made available for backing up other computers' files.

Project 1 done cooperatively with [Nuno Ramos](https://github.com/NunoRamos).
